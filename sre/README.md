What you will do

    Own GKE (Autopilot or Standard): cluster setup, hardening, autoscaling, node pools, blue/green and canary rollouts

    Build CI/CD pipelines: GitHub Actions (or Cloud Build/Cloud Deploy) from PR to production; Helm for releases (GitOps optional)

    Design for ephemeral execution at scale: Kubernetes Jobs/CronJobs, queue/worker patterns, graceful shutdown, retries, backoff, and idempotency

    Collaborate directly with the CTO on a backend control plane that dispatches and orchestrates tiny container images at millisecond-scale latency with APIs, concurrency controls, and backpressure
    Build observability: metrics, logs, tracing with Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, or Cloud Monitoring & Logging; define SLO/SLI dashboards and actionable alerts

    Secure and isolate workloads with Workload Identity, secrets management, RBAC, and network policies
    Optimize cost and performance through right-sizing requests/limits, node pool tuning, cold-start reduction, and smart caching

    Lead reliability engineering: incident response, runbooks, post-mortems, and proactive failure drills
